<!-- ## Deployment

The [Deployed Site](https://staley-store.netlify.app/) will take about 60 seconds to display content due to the backend server having to spin up, being a free instance on Render.com. -->


## Overview

The Cable Store application powers an online storefront that allows users to browse product offerings by several search parameters, place items in their shopping cart, and check out when they are ready to make their purchase.

### Technical Overview

The application is created with the following overall architecture and methodologies:

- React
- ES6 Classes
- Redux Store for Application State
- Deployed API with MongoDB storage for storing categories and products
- Superagent or Axios for performing API Requests

- Test Driven Development, using Jest
<!-- - Deployment to a cloud provider (Netlify, Amplify, or GitHub Pages) -->
